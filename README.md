# PCNY-Demastered

Hi! I see you've found the PCNY Demastered archive. What is this place, you ask?

In a nutshell, it's an attempt to preserve PCNY Pokémon "as they were (re)discovered" by archivists - often lightly modified, and sometimes heavily so, from their original Hoenn condition.

This work is important due to the circumstances in which PCNY Pokémon first began to be (mass) traded. With the advent of global WiFi connectivity in Generation Sinnoh and the concomitant blossoming of a Pokémon trading scene starting June 2007, many PCNY were transferred up from Hoenn via the PalPark for the first time. While a boon to collectors, this also meant the PCNY were taken out of their natural environs and beamed out onto the web. Where, in the 15-odd years that followed, they experienced a veritable diaspora and were subject to the whims of their new owner(s). Some PCNY emerged from the intervening years relatively unscathed, while others were subjected to sometimes extensive modification (and some were outright lost). Here an attempt is made to preserve such "battered beauties" in their state of (re)discovery __alongside__ restorations to original condition.

In so doing, this repository may be considered the file archive complement to the "PCNY Preservation Records" as documented on pokemonhistorian.com/pcny-project/pcny-preservation-records.

The result is filenames that look as follows:

PCNYc 00062 Kingdra (Ice beam) [Bashful] -GoldUrsaring (t).pk4 

Where each element indicates:

- PCNYc: Trainer Name PCNY b/c/d.
- 00062: TID number, ranging from 00001 to a theoretical maximum of 65535, but a practical upper limit of an estimated 01400.
- Kingdra: Species name.
- (Ice Beam): Moveset variant where applicable, currently only to BC and CD Dragon variants.
- [Bashful]: Pokémon nature.
- -GoldUrsaring: Documented original owner, ie. the individual who claimed the Pokémon at PokeCenter New York in 2003-5. Left blank where unknown.
- (t): Indicates that a Pokémon was "touched", to invoke event collector jargon, meaning that one or more of its qualities (e.g. moveset, level, EVs, experience points) was altered from pristine "untouched" condition as dispensed from PCNY equipment by its original owner(s) prior to the Pokémon's documentation.

Filenames may also include the (r) suffix to denote *restoration* to .pk3 from .pk4/.pk6/.pkm <u>and/or</u> reversal of modifications to moveset, level, experience points, EVs, etc. Like so:

PCNYc 00062 Seadra (Ice beam) [Bashful] -GoldUrsaring (r).pk3

The product contrasts with, for example, the aforementioned PP GitHub, where only third-party restorations to pristine .pk3 format are hosted, moreover without accompanying documentation <I>which</I> PCNY underwent such treatment, and from what condition.

In terms of limitations, this repository can only include PCNY Pokémon that are currently in the public domain.

It is our hope that more PCNY may become available for players the world over to enjoy in future years.
